## Welcome to my pageðŸ‘‹
I am a PhD student at the University of Antwerp, Belgium. My research is concerned with dependability analysis, robustness 
checking, validation, and verification technique for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) using model-based fault-injection. My main focus 
is on the optimization of model-based fault-injection using a combination of machine learning and model-based techniques. 

I am currently working on an Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based method to optimize fault-injcention.
I am currently learning different machine learning approches that can be applied for dependability analysis of CPS.
