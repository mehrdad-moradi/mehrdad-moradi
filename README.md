## Welcome to my pageðŸ‘‹
I am a PhD student at the University of Antwerp, Belgium. My research is concerned with dependability analysis, robustness 
checking, validation, and verification technique for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) using model-based fault-injection. My main focus 
is on the optimization of model-based fault-injection using a combination of machine learning and model-based techniques. 

I am currently working on an Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based method to optimize fault-injcention.
I am currently learning different machine learning approches that can be applied on black-box (FMI standard based model) and white-box (Simulink-based model) CPSs for dependability analysis.

## Research interest
* Dependability Analysis:
  * Safety Assessment 
  * Fault-Injection
  * Hazard Analysis
  * Validation and Verification
* Model-Based System Engineering
* Machine Learning  
* Embedded System Design and Analysis
* Electronic Design Automation (ASIC/FPGA)
* Image Processing
